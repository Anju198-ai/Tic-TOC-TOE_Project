TIC-TAC-TOE game is a very easy game which is mostly played among children and also help to improve their concentration.
The objective of this TIC-TAC-TOE game python project is to build a tic-tac-toe game so you can play it without wasting paper and improve your concentration to build this game we use the thinker module with concept of python.
To play this game we require two players to play one is X and another is O and the both players play by putting their marks in empty squares.   
Traditionally the first plays with “X”. So you can decide who wants to go with “X” and who wants to go with “O”.
Only one player can play at a time.
If any of the players have filled a square then the other player cannot override that square.
There are only two condition that may match will be draw or may win.
The player that succeeds in placing three respective marks(X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row win this game.
This basic idea has been suggested many times. An algorithm of playing tic-tac-toe has been presented and tested that work in efficient way. Overall the system works without any bugs.
